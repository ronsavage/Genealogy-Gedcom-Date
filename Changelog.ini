- Patch code and tests for Solaris, where Data::Infinite::(Past, Future) return '-Infinity' and 'Infinity'.
- Turn off debug in tests.

[V 1.06]
Date=2012-03-22T09:18:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes. No need to upgrade.
- The only patch is that debug is enabled in all test scripts. The point is to report as much information
as possible when CPAN Testers using Solaris run tests. Unfortunately, no CPAN Tester in this situation
has responded to my direct emails, so I'm using this mechanism to get the info I need. This is all part
of the mess MS Windows and Solaris make when failing to handle Data::Infinite::(Past, Future).
The next version will of course just have debug turned off again, along with a Solaris fix.
After that, I never want to hear about this problem again.

Comments= <<EOT
- CPAN testing showed more cases where the patches in V 1.02 had to be applied.
1.04 Fri Mae 16 14:37:00 2012
- Aggghhhh. Fix tests to match fix in V 1.03. Tests worked under Debian of course.

[V 1.03]
Date=2012-03-14T17:16:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add complexity to the fix for problems to Data::Infinite::(Past, Future) for OSes:
o Win32::GetOSName = Win7
o Win32::GetOSName = WinXP/.Net

[V 1.02]
Date=2012-03-13T08:57:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Bump pre-reqs for DateTime and DateTime::Inifinite from V 0.70 to V 0.72, since these are the latest (today).
- Fix sub _init_flags() for systems where DateTime::Infinite::Past is returned as '-1.#INF' instead of '-inf'.
For testing, this only affects the 2 tests in t/escape.t where we expect '-inf' as the output for one_date.
For end users of course, the change in sub _init_flags() is what matters.
- Update the docs to explain that '-inf' is returned even when the system returns '-1.#INF'.

[V 1.01]
Date=2012-02-29T09:35:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes.
- Update pre-req Hash::FieldHash from V 0.10 to V 0.12, in presumably hopeless attempt to rectify a CPAN Tester report about failure under MS Windows.
See: http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/9c177958-6ca0-1014-a634-88fc0063837e. The code tests perfectly on my Debian stable system.

[V 1.00]
Date=2011-09-20T13:47:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Initial release. This is an updated version of DateTime::Format::Gedcom V 1.00.
This latter module is deprecated. Details in the FAQ.
- Changes since DateTime::Format::Gedcom:
o The hashref returned by the parse_*() methods includes 4 new keys:
one_default_day, one_default_month, two_default_day and two_default_month.
This allows the caller to determine whether or not the code inserted a day
and/or month into an incomplete date. Years are never inserted into dates.
This matches a feature available in Gedcom::Date, but with a completely
different implementation.
o There is a new parameter 'style' passable into new() and the parse_*() methods.
It takes the values 'american', 'english' and 'standard', to allow the code
to expect dates formatted in various ways. The parameter is not called
format because I have plans to use format as the name for a parameter which
will allow to user to specify the output format of the dates.
