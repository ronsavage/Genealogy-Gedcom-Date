Revision history for Perl extension Genealogy::Gedcom::Date.

1.00  Thu Sep 20 13:47:00 2011
	  - Initial release. This is an updated version of DateTime::Format::Gedcom V 1.00.
	  	This latter module is deprecated. Details in the FAQ.
	  - Changes since DateTime::Format::Gedcom:
	  	o The hashref returned by the parse_*() methods includes 4 new keys:
		  one_default_day, one_default_month, two_default_day and two_default_month.
		  This allows the caller to determine whether or not the code inserted a day
		  and/or month into an incomplete date. Years are never inserted into dates.
		  This matches a feature available in Gedcom::Date, but with a completely
		  different implementation.
		o There is a new parameter 'style' passable into new() and the parse_*() methods.
		  It takes the values 'american', 'english' and 'standard', to allow the code
		  to expect dates formatted in various ways. The parameter is not called
		  format because I have plans to use format as the name for a parameter which
		  will allow to user to specify the output format of the dates.
		  american => Expect 'month day year', as in From Jan 2 2011 BC to Mar 4 2011.
		  english  => Expect 'day month year', as in From 1 Jan 2001 to 25 Dec 2002.
		  standard => Expect 'year month day', as in From 2011-01-02 to 2011-03-04.
		  See t/style.t for sample code.
		o Gregorian is the only supported date escape. Every date escape triggers
		  processing using Gregorian month names and abbreviations.
		o DateTime::Format::Natural is no longer used. Instead, the incoming date is
		  split on [ -\/] rather than just [ -], and this module tries to parse it.
		o All commas are deleted from incoming dates.
		o BC may be written as BCE.
		o Some dates which are not ambiguous, e.g. 2011-01-01, were wrongly flagged
		  as ambiguous. Thanx to Eugene van der Pijll for alerting me to this bug.
